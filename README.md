## Installation :hammer_and_wrench:

Please run
```
export PS1='[\u@\h \W]\$ '

conda create -n hyirl python=3.8.18 -y
conda activate hyirl
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
then, assuming you are at the top-level of this repo, run
```
export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:${PWD}
export D4RL_SUPPRESS_IMPORT_ERROR=1
```
or run
```
$env:PYTHONPATH = $env:PYTHONPATH + ";" + (Get-Location)
$env:D4RL_SUPPRESS_IMPORT_ERROR = "1"
```
in windows!

## Experiments :computer:

For all experiments, please activate the conda environment created in [Installation](#installation-hammer_and_wrench).
```
conda activate hyirl
```
choose 1 2 or 3 below to get demonstration data
### 1.Downloading Original Data
We provide the original datasets used for the mujoco locomotion environments in the paper. These can be acquired by running
```
python experts/download_datasets.py
```
which will download the corresponding datasets for all of `Ant-v3`, `Hopper-v3`, `Humanoid-v3`, and `Walker2d-v3`. 

Since `antmaze` demonstrations are downloaded directly from [D4RL](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/D4RL), there is no need to train an expert beforehand. Please directly run `collect_demos.py`, which will download the dataset, run some additional processing, and save all relevant keys to the `.npz` file.


### 2.Collecting Demonstration Data
To train your own experts, please run the following script
```
python experts/train.py --env <env_name>
```
An expert will be trained for the desired environment, and a checkpoint will be saved in `experts/<env_name>`. Then, to use this checkpoint to collect new trajectories, please run the following
```
python experts/collect_demos.py --env <env_name>
```
Demonstrations will be saved as an `.npz` file containing the following entries: `observations`, `actions`, `next_observations`, `rewards`, `terminals`, `timeouts`, `seed`, `qpos`, and `qvel`. 

To extend to more experiments, simply add the new environment to the list of arguments allowed in `experts/train.py`, then run the two scripts above. Policy optimizers for the expert can also be switched out easily, provided the same is done in `experts/collect_demos.py` when loading the checkpoint. 

当然！只给你 **3**，保持和你之前写的风格一致：

### 3. Converting Your Own Demonstration Data  
If you already have your own demonstration dataset (e.g., collected from a different framework or custom environment), you can convert it into the required `.npz` format using our conversion script:  
```
python tests/utils/convert_demos.py --input <your_demo_file> --output <converted_demo_file>
```

The input file should contain your demonstration data in a structured format (e.g., pickle, JSON, or numpy).  
The conversion script will process the data and output an `.npz` file compatible with the training and evaluation pipelines in this repository.

The resulting `.npz` file will include the following keys:  
`observations`, `actions`, `next_observations`, `rewards`, `terminals`, `timeouts` (optional), `seed` (optional), `qpos` (optional), and `qvel` (optional).

> [!TIP]  
> Make sure your input data includes at least `observations`, `actions`, and `rewards`. Additional information such as `next_observations`, `terminals`, and `timeouts` is recommended for compatibility with model-based algorithms.

---

> [!NOTE]
> This repository currently does not support `gymnasium` versions of environments. We are working on updating our files to support newer versions of `gym` and `gymnasium`. 


### Antmaze Model Pretraining（don't need to finish cause we just use it as baseline）
We found that pretraining the model for model-based antmaze experiments and decreasing model update frequency helped improve stability. Thus, we also provide the script to pretrain the antmaze models, which can be modified to other environments as well. The pretrained model checkpoints used in the paper can be found under `garage\pretrained_models\<env_name>`. To create your own pretrained model, run
```
python main.py algorithm=pretrain_antmaze overrides=model_based_antmaze_diverse
```
or
```
python main.py algorithm=pretrain_antmaze overrides=model_based_antmaze_play
```

To find more details on the specific pretraining process, please reference [here](garage/algorithms#antmaze-model-pretraining).

### Reproducing Runs
To recreate the main plots seen in the paper, first run
```
cd garage
```
This repository organizes configuration files for various experiments using [hydra](https://hydra.cc/), which can be found in [`garage/config`](garage/config), and one just needs to specify the algorithm and environment they wish to run it on. For example, to run `HyPE` on `Walker2d-v3`:

maybe for windows should run 
```
export MUJOCO_PY_MUJOCO_PATH=~/.mujoco/mujoco210
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/.mujoco/mujoco210/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/.mujoco/mujoco210/lib

```

```
python main.py algorithm=hype overrides=model_free_walker
```
or to run `HyPER` on `Ant-v3`:
```
python main.py algorithm=hyper overrides=model_based_ant
```

This package supports training of the following algorithms:
* MM: A baseline moment-matching algorithm that uses an integral probability metric instead of Jensen Shannon divergence as implemented by [FastIRL](https://github.com/gkswamy98/fast_irl/blob/master/learners/filt.py).
* BC-Reg: MM with an added Mean-Square Error Loss on the actor update. 
* FILTER: IRL with resets to expert states.
* HyPE: Model-free IRL with policy updates on both learner and expert state-action pairs.
* HyPE+FILTER: HyPE with resets to expert states.
* HyPER: Model-based IRL variant of HyPE, building off [LAMPS-MBRL](https://github.com/vvanirudh/LAMPS-MBRL/blob/master/MujocoSysID/mbrl/algorithms/lamps.py).

on the following environments:
* Ant-v3 (ant)
* Hopper-v3 (hopper)
* Humanoid-v3 (humanoid)
* Walker2d-v3 (walker)
* antmaze-large-diverse-v2 (maze-diverse)
* antmaze-large-play-v2 (maze-play)


> [!TIP]
> For a more detailed breakdown of the `garage` repository, please see [here](garage/README.md). For a specific breakdown of our implementations of model-free and model-based inverse reinforcement learning, please see [here](garage/algorithms/README.md).

> [!TIP] 
> All configs are filled with the exact hyperparameters used in the paper. If one wishes to adapt these algorithms to different environments or datasets, we provide a detailed list of recommendations on which parameters we recommend tuning first [here](garage/README.md/#hyperparameter-search).


### Plotting Results
Results are saved in two locations. For all config files, model checkpoints, and all other detailed logs of the run, they are saved under `garage\experiment_logs\<algorithm>\`. A copy of the final evaluation results are saved under `garage\experiment_results\`. To generate graphs for one environment, run
```
python plot.py --env <env_name>
```
You can also generate graphs for all environments that have saved results by running
```
python plot.py --all
```

## Acknowledgements :pencil:

This project is based on the original [Hybrid Inverse Reinforcement Learning (HYPE)](https://github.com/jren03/garage) implementation. We have significantly modified and extended the codebase to support **a broader range of RL environments (Gym, MuJoCo, Atari)** and introduced **KL divergence & reward-based evaluation** as additional benchmarking metrics.

The original HyPER algorithm was built on [LAMPS-MBRL](https://github.com/vvanirudh/LAMPS-MBRL/tree/e67085533e64201efef9a3053d9445bbabbddee8), and HyPE was built on [FastIRL](https://github.com/gkswamy98/fast_irl/tree/master). Our modifications focus on extending their applicability and improving performance analysis.

Below is a brief summary of the extra steps we took to get this project running on a server **without sudo privileges**. These steps can be appended to the README:

---

### Additional Steps for Non-sudo Environments

1. **Installed required libraries via Conda**  
   We used conda-forge to install packages normally installed via system-level commands. For instance:
   ```bash
   conda install -c conda-forge glew mesa xorg-libx11 xorg-libxi xorg-libxext patchelf
   ```
   This resolves errors like missing `<GL/glew.h>` and makes the `patchelf` tool available (needed by `mujoco-py`).

2. **Set compiler/linker environment variables**  
   Because the compiler may not look into Conda’s `include`/`lib` paths by default, we added them:
   ```bash
   export CPATH="$CONDA_PREFIX/include:$CPATH"
   export LIBRARY_PATH="$CONDA_PREFIX/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH"
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$CONDA_PREFIX/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
   ```

3. **Installed MuJoCo 2.1.0 manually**  
   Since `mujoco-py` only provides Python bindings, we downloaded `mujoco210-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` from [MuJoCo.org](https://mujoco.org/), extracted it into `~/.mujoco/`, and named the directory `mujoco210`. This is where `mujoco-py` expects to find the native libraries:
   ```
   ~/.mujoco/mujoco210/bin/libmujoco210.so
   ```

4. **Installed `mujoco-py`**  
   With all dependencies in place, we simply ran:
   ```bash
   pip install mujoco-py
   ```
   It compiled successfully within our Conda environment.

5. **Ran the script headlessly**  
   - We occasionally saw a `GLFWError: X11: The DISPLAY environment variable is missing`. This can be ignored when running headless, or you can set:
     ```bash
     export MUJOCO_GL=egl
     ```
     to switch to a headless EGL backend.
   - We also got a Numpy C-API warning (`module compiled against API version 0x10 but this version is 0xe`). It did not break anything, so we ignored it. If it causes issues, you can reinstall Numpy and rebuild related packages to match the correct C-API version.

After these adjustments, the program started successfully with:
```bash
python main.py algorithm=hype overrides=model_free_walker
```

and began training without further errors.（https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py/issues/627）
